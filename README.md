## Known issues
- Unexpected behavior when trying to cast to a Chromecast while it's booting (or just booted). This is an issue in the `chromecast-osx-audio` module dependency.
- Sometimes the default `menubar` cat icon is shown for a few seconds instead of the Chromecast icon when launching Soundcast.
- Incompatible with chromecasts including double quotes (") in their name.
 
## Windows users

Soundcast only works on Mac OS X, but there exists a similar app for Windows: [Chromecast Audio Stream](https://github.com/acidhax/chromecast-audio-stream)
